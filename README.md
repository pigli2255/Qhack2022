# QUANTUM-CLASSICAL TIC-TAC-TOE

## TEAM : HAQERS 


For the **QHACK 2022 OPEN CHALLENGE** we decided to create a unique **Quantum-classical tic-tac-toe**.

It is a variation of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe

[Qhack Open Hackathon Project Folder/Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/pigli2255/Qhack2022/tree/master/Qhack%20Open%20Hackathon%20Project)

The game explores superposition properties of qubits as follows:


 - The game has 2 players, player1 and player2
 - The tiles can be marked in a Classical way or in a Quantum way.
 - The game allows a player to switch between two modes: **Quantum mode** or **Classical mode**.
 - By default, Player1 makes a tile with a |0> and player2 makes a tile with a |1>.
 - Quantum mode has an interesting twist,  During a player turn, a player can decide to entangle two tiles instead of marking a tile.
 -  If that is the case, then the entangled tiles can not be marked for any other player during the game.
 - Once all the tiles are marked or entangled the quantum circuit of the game is initialized and the qubits are measured reviling the final state of the game.
 - We then run an Error-correcting algorithm by repetition.
 - Who ever has 3 in a line wins. If both will then the code is run again until one one wins.


The repository consists of two main project files : 
- game_interface.py
- back-end.py


The main component of the game is **back-end.py**

We used 9 different qubits to represent the tiles and then designed an algorithm to allow entaglement when players switch to Quantum mode.


| 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 0 | 1 | 2 |


We take the inputs of both player and respresent them as Quantum states, such that we have a list of marking by player_1 (whose states are *|0>* ) and list of inputs from Player_2 whose states are *|1>*)

```
l_player_1 = [0] #list of qbits cell numbers inicialized to 0
l_player_2 = [2,3] #list of qbits cell numbers inicialized to 1
l_entangled = [(1,6),(7,8),(4,5)] #list of pairs of cells that need to be entangled to |01>+|10>

# Create a Quantum Circuit acting on the q register
circuit = QuantumCircuit(9, 9)
circuit.name = "Tic tac toe"


for inx  in range(len(l_player_2)):
    circuit.x(l_player_2[inx])
for inx in range(len(l_entangled)):
    circuit.h(l_entangled[inx][0])
    circuit.x(l_entangled[inx][1])
    circuit.cx(l_entangled[inx][0],l_entangled[inx][1])
circuit.measure(list(range(9)), list(range(9)))

# Print out the circuit
circuit.draw()
```
This generates the quantum circuits representing the tic toc toe game, based on the 3 input lists.

print(result.get_counts())
print(list(map(lambda x: int(x),list(list(result.get_counts().keys())[0][::-1]))))


We then transform  output register string into a list of integers in the right order so the first element corresponds to the first tile
```
print(result.get_counts())
print(list(map(lambda x: int(x),list(list(result.get_counts().keys())[0][::-1]))))

result:
{'010011110': 1}
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```
0 0 1

1 0 1

0 1 1

In this case Player 2 wins : )
